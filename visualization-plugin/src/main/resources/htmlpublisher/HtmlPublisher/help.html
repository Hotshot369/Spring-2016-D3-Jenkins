    <p>
        Publishes HTML reports.
        Fill the path to the directory containing the HTML reports in the "HTML
        directory to archive" field. Specify the pages to display (default
        index.html); you can specify multiple comma-separated pages and each will
        be a tab on the report page. Finally, give a name in the Report Title
        field, which will be used to provide a link to the report.
    </p>

    <p>
        By default, only the most recent HTML report will be saved, but if you'd like to be
        able to view HTML reports for each past build, select "Keep past HTML
        reports." If you keep past HTML reports then only the last successful
        build will be linked on the job page or select "Always link to last build
        on job page" to also link to failed builds.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the configured HTML can not be found, the build will be marked as
        "failed". If you want to make the publishing of the report optional,
        select "Allow missing report".
    </p>
